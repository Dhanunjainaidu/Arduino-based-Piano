# Arduino-based-Piano
Creating a piano with Arduino involves using buttons as keys and producing sound with a piezo buzzer.

Arduino-Based Piano Project
This project involves creating a piano using an Arduino UNO microcontroller, push buttons as keys, and a piezo buzzer for generating realistic piano sounds.

# Hardware Components
Arduino UNO microcontroller
Push buttons (7 in this example)
Piezo buzzer
Jumper wires
Breadboard
# Wiring Instructions
Connect push buttons to digital pins on the Arduino UNO. Update the buttonPins array in the code accordingly.

Connect the piezo buzzer to a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) digital pin on the Arduino UNO. Update the buzzerPin in the code accordingly.

Ensure proper grounding connections between components.

# Arduino IDE Setup
Open the Arduino IDE.

Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into a new sketch.

Connect the Arduino UNO to your computer using a USB cable.

Select the correct board and port from the "Tools" menu in the Arduino IDE.

Upload the code to the Arduino UNO.

# Usage
Upload the code to the Arduino UNO using the Arduino IDE.

Press the push buttons connected to the Arduino to play piano notes.

Enjoy creating music with your Arduino-based piano!

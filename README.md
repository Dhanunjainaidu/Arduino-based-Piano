# Arduino-based-Piano
Creating a piano with Arduino involves using buttons as keys and producing sound with a piezo buzzer.

->This project involves creating a piano using an Arduino UNO microcontroller, push buttons as keys, and a piezo buzzer for generating realistic piano sounds.

# Hardware Components
-Arduino UNO microcontroller

-Push buttons (7 in this project) 

-Piezo buzzer

-Jumper wires

-Breadboard
# Wiring Instructions
-Connect push buttons to digital pins on the Arduino UNO. Update the buttonPins array in the code accordingly.

-Connect the piezo buzzer to a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) digital pin on the Arduino UNO. Update the buzzerPin in the code accordingly.

-Ensure proper grounding connections between components.
